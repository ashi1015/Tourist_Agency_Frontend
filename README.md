### Project Description
> Tourist Travel Agency is system build for the Tourists (Foreign) who wish to travel different places in Sri Lanka. This web application is built to attract the Tourists. Therefore we have taken partnership with different Locations, hotels, transport facilities (Vehicles), and also with Tourist Guides. Tourists might decide on to travel in Sri Lanka by checking the Temperature differences, altitudes and other weather conditions. Our system provides all the necessary facilities for the tourists to enjoy different locations in Sri Lanka. The major functionalities of this system are hotel booking, tourists handling, booking locations remotely and handling and assigning tourist guides for requested tourists. Tourists will be able to find the most eye-catching locations anywhere in Sri Lanka with just a few clicks. Tourists who are visiting the website will be able to view a list of locations with images, and a brief description of every location. The users will also have the ability to view more details of a particular location. The admins of the system will be able to add new locations, view the list of locations added, update the details of existing locations, delete locations and search locations by area. When adding locations admins will have to upload an image of the location as well. All the data and images entered by the admin will be validated to make sure that they are in the correct format.Searching for best and most suitable hotels by visiting each hotel nearby is a difficult task. By using our system, Tourists can search, book hotels with preferable number of rooms and facilities, add or remove rooms and many other options can be done by just few clicks. The two types of users who are, Guest and Registered Tourists has the accessibility to surf our website to select the best suitable hotel with the most attractive rooms and facilities as their wish. Therefore, in the Hotel page we have given both the user types to search their most preferable hotel but in order to book the hotel they have to be a signed up as a registered user for this system. Registered users/Tourists can book, update their booking details, add more hotels and hotel facilities, and also remove hotels before booking. The two types of Tourists who are, Guest and Registered Tourists have the accessibility to surf our website. As a guest, he or she can visit the hotels details, tour guide details and location details. But he or she must register to the system before making a booking. By entering correct details, guest user can register to the system and be a registered tourist. After a successful registration process, a tourist profile will be created. Tourist can view, update, and delete their profiles only after successfully logged-in to the system. After successfully logged-in, registered tourist can booking hotels, select locations to visit and also can choose relevant tourist guide for her or his tour. For a successful login, the user must enter the correct email and password which they used in the registration. As the Admin, he or she can search tourists by registration date or tourist name and view their details and generate reports.Sightseeing alone can get confusing sometimes, the tourist could get lost or not know the shortest or the scenic way around the place. As a tourist using our system, they can also book a guide to travel with them to make use of their knowledge. In addition, the system will provide vehicles for the users if needed, and tourist guides would join them. Everything is overseen by the manager, who will be the one to add tourist guides and vehicles, while their availability is automatically updated by the system, and he can delete any vehicle or guide if they are no longer working with the agency.
Benefit of using our web application is that Guest users and Registered users both can surf and plan their vacation effectively in a cost-effective manner. Thereby, saving their time and money while providing them the best service.
